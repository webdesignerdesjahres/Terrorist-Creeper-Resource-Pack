## Issues

As of current Minecraft Java Edition 1.21.1, it seems there is an issue where both creepers and TNT use the same sound file, sounds/random/fuse.ogg, but at different speeds. This setup causes TNT to emit a sped-up version of the Terrorist's scream sound when ignited. creeperfuse.ogg does not seem to be in use...
